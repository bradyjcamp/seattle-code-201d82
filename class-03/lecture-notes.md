# Class 03 Lecture Notes

## Arrays!!

- Data Type or Data Structure **special type of object**
- A list, or collection of elements - can be mixed...
  - contain strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects
- In JS we don't have pretermine the size of arrays
- Every element in the array has an index(location reference)
- Zero based index system
  - first element array will be index 0

- Built in Methods! They need the `()` to execute.
  - `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.includes()`

- Properties
  - `length`

## Loops

### For Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - Great for doing something a certain number of times
  - Great for iterating or looping through arrays!

```javascript
for(starting value; condition; increment){
  do something for a finite number of times
}
```

### While Loops

- JS Control flow logic
  - While loops do something until the condition is false
  - Beware of infinite loops!

```javascript
while(condition){
  do soemthing until the condition is false
}
```
