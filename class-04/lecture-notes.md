## Fun with Functions!

- a new data type

### What is a function?

- A function is a group of statements or code that perform a task or calcuate a value. Stored within a structure that prevents them from running until the function is called or invoked.

### Why do we use functions?

- functions are reusable
- functions help keep our code DRY (do not repeat yourself)

### Two Process

- Define/Declare our function
- Call/Run

## CSS Positioning

2 types

- static-type
- relative-type
  - relative
  - absolute
  - fixed

### Static - standard - element sits where it normally

### Position Relative

Elements that are `position: relative` can be moved out of their normal flow position while still taking up the same space. This is achieved by utilising those offset properties (top, bottom, left, right) to offset the element, relative to itself.

### Position Absolute

Essentially does the same thing as position: relative, with two key differences:
The element is taken out of normal flow and leaves no space behind.
The element is positioned relative to its nearest parent with a relative-type (relative, absolute, fixed) positioning.

### Position Fixed

fixed is the same as absolute with one key difference:
The element is positioned relative to the viewport.
