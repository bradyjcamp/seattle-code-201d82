## Data Types

- A way of labeling and organizing our data
- A way to format data that our program can anticipate and use the data properly

JavaScript **loosely typed** and **dynamic**

- Loosely typed means that we don't have to know the type of data to declare a variable.
- Variables do not need to be declared with a type.

`let cat;`

- Dynamic meaning I can change the type of data after the variable has been defined.

`let cat = 3`

`cat = 'meow'`

`cat = true`

## Primitives

- A data type that cannot be broken down into something more basic

### Numbers

- Numeric data type, can be decimals, can be negative...written with no special notation:
  - `4`

### Strings

- A sequence of characters used to represent text.. can be letter or other characters like numbers or symbols. Denoted with single quotes.
  - `'4'`
  - `'hello'`

## Booleans

- Logical data type, can only be true or false. Use this a lot in validation. Denoted with no special notation.
  - `true`
  - `false`

### Undefined

- Something that does not yet have a definition.
  - `'let cat;`

### Null

- Something explicitly defined as none
  - `let cat = null;`
